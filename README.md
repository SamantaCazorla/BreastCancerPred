The Breast Cancer Diagnosis app is a machine learning tool designed to help medical professionals diagnose breast cancer. By analyzing a set of measurements, it predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. The app provides a visual representation of the input data with a radar chart and displays the diagnosis along with the probabilities of being benign or malignant. Users can manually input the measurements on the slide bars.

The app was developed as a machine learning exercise using the public Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set. Note that this dataset may not be reliable, as the project was created for educational purposes in the field of machine learning only and not for professional use.
